page.colourblind.0=It happened in a blink. One minute I was admiring the world around me then suddenly the colour went. I couldn't see the red in the rose, the grass looked bleak and the sun dull.

page.welcome.0.title=Dear Diary...
page.welcome.0.tab=Welcome
page.welcome.0=It's been getting worse lately. My skin itches and these black spots are appearing. It hurts like hell to remove them, almost like that skin is still alive. I can't keep tearing off my own skin.
page.welcome.1.title=How to "win"
page.welcome.1=That crazy villager told me to kill a dragon. Where am I going to find a dragon!? He said it's the only way to stop this corruption. Maybe those rumors of hidden strongholds are true, ones with portal to The End

page.afraidOfTheDark.0.tab=AotD
page.afraidOfTheDark.0=I'm pretty sure I'm going insane now. I swear I heard a creeper behind me just earlier but there was nothing there. Same again just a minute ago but it was a zombie. I don't know what's real anymore...

page.blockTeleport.0.tab=B. Teleport
page.blockTeleport.0=Something weird is happening. I can't mine any blocks! I hit it with my pick and then it just vanishes. But then sometimes they turn up in another location, the same block. Maybe it's a weird enchantment
page.bloodLoss.0.subtitle=I can't remember my blood type!
page.bloodLoss.0.title=Blood Loss
page.bloodLoss.0.tab=Blood Loss
page.bloodLoss.0=I almost died today. I was surrounded by zombies and could barely move. I felt weaker then usual, I could barely move my legs. It was like something was taking over my legs and stopping them from moving.
page.stoneSkin.0.subtitle=Not The Rock
page.stoneSkin.0.title=Stone Skin
page.stoneSkin.0.tab=Stone Skin
page.stoneSkin.0=Well my skin turned gray today. That's different then black at least but it felt like stone. It crumbled away in my hand if I touched it. It didn't last long though and soon the "stone" vanished and the black spots returned.
page.waterAllergy.0.subtitle=I'm meeeeeeeeltiiiiiiiiiiing

page.waterAllergy.0.tab=W. Allergy
page.waterAllergy.0=Half my skin is currently banadaged right now from burns. But it was water that burned me. I jumped into the lake to start fishing and the next thing I know it felt like my lower half was on fire.
page.enderCake.0=A crazy villager came up to me today. He was shouting something about cake and ender pearls and corruption cure? He had the same block spots as I did, maybe he will know more information.
page.enderCake.0.title=Ender Cake
page.enderCake.0.subtitle=My stomach feels funny...

page.fleshArmor.0=I had a crazy idea today. I tried attaching some flesh to leather armour and made... something. I gave it to that crazy villager. He said that he felt like it was preventing corruption but I'm pretty sure he ate part of it instead.

chat.corruption.1=Oh my what do we have here? Is this... yes it is! A new victim, oh I'm so happy! It's been some time since I got to play with my toys.
chat.corruption.2=You're probably wondered who I am. That's not important, I've had many different people call me different names but a name is just a name after all.
chat.corruption.3=Either way, yes, welcome! Make yourself at home, I'm going to be placing a curse on you now and watching you until either you get consumed by it or manage to beat it.
chat.corruption.4=Why you ask? For fun of course! I suggest you make a diary, it'll help you keep track of everything. Toodles!
chat.corruption.5=Oh yes one more thing, I'll check in on you every now and then. You won't be able to see me of course but it will be exciting to see how you're doing.
chat.corruption.logout=Hah as if that will work. You can't escape this and as punishment for trying, let's speed up the corruption a little yes? Now where was I...
